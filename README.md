## TO Create a new repository

1. Create a public repository in Github, Don't initialze it with anything.
2. Creat a new project in Cloud9. Give it the same name. Be sure you're logged in with your GitHub credentials.
3. In cloud 9 terminal:  
  

    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:erikfreer/git-example.git
    git add -A
    git status
